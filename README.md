There is a need for microcomputer firmware to be stored in Rom so that the CPU can boot directly from it when power is applied. Having large amounts of ROM that the CPU can execute code directly from is becoming less “fashionable” because the required chips to support it are both physically large (48-pin packages are common) and not particularly dense (in an age of multi-megabyte or even gigabyte storage) due to their reliance on NOR flash technology with larger storage cells. 
Over the last decade, there has been a big shift towards using smaller, denser NAND Flash devices with serial load/store interfaces. This makes for a physically smaller device (8-pin surface mount packages are unbelievably tiny). However, the serial nature of these devices requires a dedicated hardware controller to sit between the CPU and the Flash memory.
